# Encryption-Schemas-with-Zip-Manipulation

An demo that shows how to do one-time encryption in browser.

If you upload a zip file it can be manipulated in the same browser (analyzed, cleaned-up).

For any file (zip or not): the file is getting encrypted ("locked") with one-time key. The key is saved, and can be shared with someone to "un-lock" the file.

Written in pure vanilla JavaScript.

To run:

- python3 server3.py
- go to localhost:8091 in your browser.
